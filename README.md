This project aims to create a web application with a dynamic dashboard featuring various functionalities, including a responsive side navigation bar, population data graph, cryptocurrency prices display, and optional MetaMask wallet integration.

### Task 1: Create a Side Navigation Bar

**Objective:** Implement a responsive side navigation bar with multiple navigation items, highlighting the active item to provide intuitive navigation.

### Task 2: Graph Population Data

**Objective:** Fetch population data from the provided API ([DataUSA API](https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population)) and visualize it using a graph, showcasing population trends for different nations over time.

### Task 3: Display Cryptocurrency Prices
